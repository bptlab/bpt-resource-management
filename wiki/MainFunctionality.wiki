#summary Description of general functionality of this tools

= Manage Entries = 

ResourceLifeCycle describes the general operations that shall be carried out by resource providers and moderators of the platform to create, update, and manage the life cycle of such a resource.

*Matthias:* From my perspective, these operations can be included in the main functions [#List_Entries], [#Search_Entries], and [#Show_Detail] for authorized providers (they can manage their own resources only) and moderators (they can manage all resources), according to their respective [ResourceLifeCycle rights].

For each resource in a list view ([#List_Entries], [#Search_Entries]) links to atomic updates of the state of the resource shall be provided (edit, un-/publish, check) that are updated via PUT requests (REST). 

All possible operations shall be available to authorized providers and moderators in the [#Show_Detail] dialogue. This includes delete and reject that are not to be shown in list views.

= List Entries =

  * list all entries, sort by different attributes
  * requires list template

= Search Entries =

  * search and filter entries by different attributes
  * provides a list of results
  * uses list template from [#List_Entries]

= Show Detail =

  * provides detailed information for each resource
  * requires separate template
