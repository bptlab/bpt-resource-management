#summary This page describes the life cycle of one resource and intended actions that can be performed by different roles.

= Roles =

We distinguish two roles, *resource providers* and *moderators*. The former provide and manage content to the platform, whereas a provider may manage several resources. Moderators have the task to approve or deny requests, and have full control over what can be seen online.

In any case, a *moderator* is always also a *provider*, that is, they can upload their own resources and control their visibility without the need to re-login as another role.
